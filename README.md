# Fantabuous Food Court
- This Website is a replica of its original [David Chu's China Bistro Website](https://www.davidchuschinabistro.com/) made by me in order to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- I have made this Website with the help of Coursera Course on [HTML, CSS and JavaScript for Web Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome). 
- I thank Coursera as well as John Hopkins University for providing me this awesome course on Web Development Technology alongwith live project demonstration and its development.
